# Axis Pension Project

Our client has been managing their employee records all these years using Microsoft Excel and it is becoming very difficult for them maintain it. Upon expert advice, they now seek to have a basic web-based employee data management system that will serve the purpose of capturing and storing employee bio data and employment information.
You are required to design and build a very basic and simple web application that can be used to serve this purpose.
Features of the application

1. An appealing user interface (must include Employer Logo)
